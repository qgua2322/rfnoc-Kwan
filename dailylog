incoming_ce_timestamp at timestamp[47:32]
incoming_axi_timestamp at timestamp[31:16]
outcoming_IP_timestamp at timestamp[15:0]
outcoming_axi_timestamp at payload[47:32]
outcoming_ce_timestamp at payload[31:16]

All the incoming timestamp will fail when the operating cycle of IP higher than the time different of two continue packet.
(Remain to be fixed)

Vivado simulation 2015.4 pass

02/07/2018

Tried to update the Vivado to 2017.4.
I could used it to generate a bitstream, but I could not run simulation on it.

I am currently using two OS, one is using Vivado 2015.4, the other is using 2017.4 .
